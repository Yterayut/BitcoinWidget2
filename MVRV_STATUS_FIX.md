# 🔧 MVRV Z-Score Status Fix

## 📊 Problem Identified
MVRV Z-Score status was showing **incorrect classification** that didn't match standard criteria.

### ❌ Before Fix:
- **Z-Score 2.10** was showing 🔴 **"Overvalued"** (incorrect)
- **Wrong Thresholds**: Used 2.0 instead of 2.4 as Fair Value limit
- **Inconsistent Range**: Multiple different classification systems

### ✅ After Fix:
- **Z-Score 2.10** now shows 🟡 **"Fair Value"** (correct)
- **Standard Thresholds**: Follows industry-standard MVRV Z-Score ranges
- **Consistent Classification**: All functions use same criteria

## 📐 Correct MVRV Z-Score Classification

### 🟢 Undervalued Zone:
- **Range**: Z-Score < -0.5
- **Meaning**: Bitcoin price is significantly below fair value
- **Investment Signal**: Good accumulation opportunity

### 🟡 Fair Value Zone:
- **Range**: -0.5 ≤ Z-Score < 2.4
- **Meaning**: Bitcoin price is near historical average
- **Investment Signal**: Normal market conditions
- **Current Status**: 2.10 = **Fair Value** ✅

### 🔴 Overvalued Zone:
- **Range**: 2.4 ≤ Z-Score < 7.0
- **Meaning**: Bitcoin price is above fair value
- **Investment Signal**: Consider taking profits

### 🔴 Extreme Bubble Zone:
- **Range**: Z-Score ≥ 7.0
- **Meaning**: Bitcoin is in extreme bubble territory
- **Investment Signal**: High risk of significant correction

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### Fixed Functions:
1. **getMvrvZScoreStatus()** - Primary status function
2. **getMvrvStatusWithIcon()** - Status with emoji icons

### Updated Thresholds:
```kotlin
// BEFORE (Wrong):

zScore < 4.0 -> "🔴 Overvalued"

zScore < 7.0 -> "🔴 Overvalued"
```

### Simplified Classification:
- **Removed**: Complex multi-level classifications

## 📱 Expected Results
