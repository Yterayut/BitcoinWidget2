# Contributing to BitcoinWidget2

We love your input! We want to make contributing to BitcoinWidget2 as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/Yterayut/BitcoinWidget2/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Yterayut/BitcoinWidget2/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Follow [Kotlin Coding Conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html)
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Add comments for complex logic
* Keep functions small and focused

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yterayut/BitcoinWidget2.git
cd BitcoinWidget2
```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
- Open Android Studio
- Select "Open an existing Android Studio project"
- Navigate to the cloned repository

3. **Build the project**
```bash
./gradlew build
```

4. **Run tests**
```bash
./gradlew test
```

## Code Review Process

1. All submissions require review before merging
2. We'll review your PR as soon as possible
3. We may ask for changes or clarifications
4. Once approved, we'll merge your PR

## Feature Requests

We're always looking for suggestions to improve our project. If you have an idea for a new feature:

1. Check if the feature already exists or is planned
2. Open an issue with the `feature request` label
3. Describe the feature in detail
4. Explain why it would be useful
5. Consider submitting a PR if you can implement it
